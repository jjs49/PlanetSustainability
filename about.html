    <h2>Planet Sustainability: An environmentally aware interactive installation</h2>
    <p>A student heading off to university enjoys the last few moments of the sunset, before they made a deal with their friends to meet up back there in 5 year.</p>
    <p>5 years later, they wake up in their apartment, where they have to get ready to go to the beach.</p>
    <p>They are then presented with a world that has been affected by people not making conscious environmental decisions. They must clean up the beach, and depending on how much they do, they will be presented with one of two optional endings.</p>
    <h3 class="bold">Good ending</h3>
    <p>If they have cleaned up the beach enough they will be brought to a good version of the beach in which the biodiversity and environment is thriving. They can explore the beach here.</p>
    <h3 class = "bold">Bad ending</h3>
    <p>If they have not cleaned enough of the beach they will be brought to a bad version of the beach where the environment has not been able to recover.</p>
    <h3 class = "bold">Game play example</h3>

    <p>One of the main elements that we wanted to reinforce through this project was the choices that people make. Both in terms of choosing to make a decision and the potential consequences of the choices made. The user is given a goal to achieve through the game play. They can choose to interact with this or the environment. There are also many choices that are not immediately indicated to the player that are available. However, these also have an effect on the final outcome of the gameplay. This is to show the player that they should be aware of their surroundings as well as being concious of the decisions that they choose to make.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Game execution</h3>
    <p>We primarily limited the number of movements for out installation, this allowed us to maneuver out entire game world with 5 different motions, which can be seen below.</p>
    <img class="demo" src="/PlanetSustainability/static/images/instructions.JPG">
    <p>From these motions the player can explore and interact with the world that we have created. There are a number of interactions which are enabled in the installation, which influence the following game play. The user is presented with the apartment. In this area they can make influential decisions affecting the environment. These are responsive and provide the player with feedback. In the apartment these decisions are not made overtly obvious, but they will affect the score required on the beach to have a positive impact on the beach. </p>

    <p>We have built a system that will remember the decisions that you make and will be remembered and change the outcome. </p>

    <p>When the player moves to the beach, they have a chance to move around the environment while interacting with other elements. They are tasked to pick up litter and put out fires.</p>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
            </div>
            <div class = "column">
                <p>For the purpose of this project, each of the members of the team were tasked to identify areas that they wished to work in. There were a number of elements each of the members of our group highlighted as areas of interest. However, all group members identified ‘Interactive Installation’ as a primary area of interest. For our project we decided to create an interactive installation with an educational background as its focus. Our team consisted of Jessica Shiel, Chetanya Kandhari, Shane Murphy and Cian Byrne. </p>

                <h2>Installation setup</h2>
            </div>
            <div class = "column">
                <p>The physical setup will consist of a projector which is to be mounted to the ceiling, a Kinect as well as 4 speakers. This will allow the user to move around the whole room without interfering with the projection. The four speakers will be placed around the user, this will allow for the creation of depth as we can use stereo sounds to allow for moving sounds. The Kinect allowed us to create an interactive environment without relying on any handheld devices, resulting in a Covid-19 friendly experience.</p>
                <img class = "image" src="/PlanetSustainability/static/images/setup.png">
                <h3>Technical Barriers</h3>

                <p>We have limited the number of responses needed for the user. Around the room we have included instructions on how to interact with the experience. There was a lot of learning throughout this project as we had little to no experience with working with the consoles as well as the software.</p>

        <div class = "row">

                <h2>Structure</h2>
            </div>
            <div class = "column">
                <p>The installation utilises an educational scenario in which the user will be first presented with a short trailer in which they will be provided with background information about the tasks that they must complete and the mechanics that they can utilise throughout.
                    </br>
                    </br>Prior to the start-up of the installation the user will be presented with a short introduction on the movements required.
                    </br>
                    </br>The Introductory video of the installation serves as guidance on the operation and functionality of the environment and scene.
                    </br>
                    </br>The user will be presented with their living environment. They will be able to explore this scene, interacting with a number of objects. Some of these interactions will have an effect on the environment later into the game. They must select a method of transport to leave this environment, otherwise they cannot travel to the exit. If a given amount of time lapses, the environment will assume that they drove as they were running late.
                    </br>
                    </br>The user will then travel to the environment and be able to interact with it. The user will then be presented with a scene. There will be am obvious environmental deterioration of the beach. The user will be given a set amount of time in which they can help collect litter and generally clean the beach.
                    </br>
                    </br>After this, the user will then be presented with the beach environment again, in which the positive impact that they have delivered so far, will be evident in the beach. If they have succeeded in their environmental treatment they will be presented with a better version of the beach. If not them will be released to the corresponding beach.
                    </br>
                    </br>The user will then be provided with backing information about the choices that they made as well the impact that they had on the environments.
                </p>
                <h3>Storyline</h3>
                <p>
                    Although this will be an educational installation, there will be a storyline present throughout with the goal being to educate the user. There are a number of elements which are identified as being part of the story;
                    </br>
                    </br>Story = Protagonist + Goal + Conflict + Obstacles + Resolution
                    </br>
                    </br>Installation Story = Protagonist (The user, by being presented with living quarters, we hope this creates a sense of immersion for the user.) + Goal (To travel to an environment with items from the living quarters and impact the environment positively) + Conflict (The user being exposed to information regarding human impact on the environment and their detrimental effect, within the simulation they will be presented with a bad scenario of the environment, the user must try to prevent this from progressing.) + Obstacles (The user will only be limited in their time to determine their environmental impact.) + Resolution (The user will then be presented with information guiding them to the most environmentally efficient items which will in turn result in a lower effect on the environment).
                </p>

                <h3>Potential Endings</h3>
                <p>Depending on the choices of the user in their home, and in the beach environment, they will be presented with one of the two different outcomes. In an effort to ‘learn from mistakes’ the user will then be presented with feedback and be given some guidance on the better decisions to make.
                </p>

                <h2>Installation Design Focus Triangle</h2>
            </div>
            <div class = "column">
                <p>Throughout the design stage of our installation, there were a number of primary elements which we desired to intertwine throughout. The Simulation aspect of the Installation allows for us to use three projectors with three screens to visualise the scene. The Vive then allows us to make the screens interactive. Allowing the user to pick and move items in the scene.
                    </br>
                    </br>The storyline was then produced in which the user was given the necessary background information in the trailer. There could be prompts throughout which will act as a guide for the mechanics of game play. Guidance on the functionality of the vive hardware will also be present to increase effectiveness of the equipment throughout the installation. This will mean that the installation will be adaptive in its placement without guidance from a developer.
                    </br>
                    </br>The Gameplay will be incorporated through the Vive handset while also utilising the Vive stand sensors, which will allow them to pinpoint the location of the user.
                    </br>
                    </br>This project rests mostly towards the simulation area of the focus triangle with small elements being from the gameplay and story sections.

            acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
                this.classList.toggle("active");
                var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
                if (panel.style.display === "block") {
                    panel.style.display = "none";
                } else {
                    panel.style.display = "block";
                }
            });
        }
    </script>


<h2>Game Logic</h2>

<p>Below is an example of the logic used to present different final outcomes within our interactive installation. It allows the system to measure choices and to accumulate values for different varaibles, which the specific ending will rely on. </p>
